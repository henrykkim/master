Henry Kim (HK): Please Introduce yourself.
Lenny Shou (LS): My name is Lenny Shou. I am 52 years old. I am originally born and raised in Seoul, Korea. I lived there until I was 14 and I came as an immigrant to the United States in 1981 along with my family. And then I moved to Atlanta in 1993 and currently a owner of Piju Belly. 
HK: Can you briefly talk about your family’s history? 
LS: Both my mom and dad are Chinese. I believe my dad was 60 years old when his family migrated to South Korea. My mom's family did the same way, but my mom was born in South Korea. We come from a huge family. Ten siblings and my mom is next to last. We had quite a big community in 60’s or 70’s. I believe there was about 350,000 to 400,000 Chinese Koreans like us that lives in South Korea. 
HK: Where was this community in South Korea?
LS: mostly in Seoul and Gyeongju area. We were always in touch and in the (Korean Chinese)noodle business. Most of us was in the restaurant business. We had our own elementary to high school, secondary school. And when you graduated from high school, we had an option to go to Taiwan. I believe there are about 25,000 Chinese people living in Korea. Many, like me, moved to the United States or went back to Taiwan. When I was growing up, I was very proud of being a Chinese holding a Chinese passport. 
HK: Fascinating, As a person who were born and raised in Korea, this is all very new.
LS: We were kind of like almost like a breed that started to go away. Some of my friends that I grew up with as elementary school kids, they're everywhere in California. Some are in Taiwan, others married Korean people and got Korean citizenship. I believe the school, our elementary and secondary school renamed themselves as international schools. Back in the days, we called it the Korean Chinese double language school.
HK: I want to learn why your parents’ families chose to move to Korea.
LS: I believe my father’s side moved because of the Japanese Chinese war. At that time, Korea was colonized by Japan so there was no war. Therefore, my grandfather decided to move for safety. On the other hand, my mother’s side moved to Korea before WWII. They did because her grandfather was a farm owner and he knew he could own a land in Korea. Labor was cheap a that time. He owned the land in Gaesung(which is part of North Korea now) and did well until Korean War. 
HK: How was your experience in Korea?
LS: Wonderful. I was born in 1967. My dad had a Chinese restaurant for 15 years, so I never had to worry about meals. I went to a special Chinese school and hung out with other Chinese and Korean friends. 
HK: Why did you family choose to move to America?
LS: Late 70’s and 80’s, immigration boom started. Many Korean people also moved. A president, at that time, thought Chinese people held too much power and wealth in Korea so he came out with many political restrictions such as not letting us buy a commercial space. We also paid much higher taxes. Couldn’t raise the food price while ingredient got more expensive. Ultimately, our opportunity was reduced significantly. Therefore, we chose to go to the land of opportunity. 
HK: When and where did you guys move to America? 
LS: June 20th, 1981. California. Within six months, my father started a restaurant business with a fellow Korean Chinese. He struggled initially. 
HK: How old were you when you moved to America? How did you adjust in a new environment?
LS: I was 14. It was miserable for the first three years. I was used to dealing with people who looked like you. Going to ESL(English as Second Language) was miserable. But I’m good at adapting and eventually enjoyed the experience. Language was also a struggle.
HK: How long did you stay in California?
LS: Until 18. I graduated high school, and my dad had an opportunity to open a second restaurant in Indiana which went quite well. But my dad passed away after three years. At that time I was in college. 
HK: When did you move to Atlanta then?
LS: After living in Indiana for 6 years, we saw the opportunity in Atlanta after the city was chosen to host ‘96 Olympics. So we put everything we had into a bandwagon, and moved to Atlanta in 1993.
HK: What did you do as you arrived?
LS: We got into the family restaurant. The first restaurant we opened was “Jade of China” which doesn’t exist anymore. Our family, mom, older sister who quitted her CPA job, older brother, and younger brother who passed away ran the restaurant along with one chef. It was truly a family-owned business. And then in 1999, I went to New York for sightseeing with my girlfriend at that time, and I found a noodle shop called Republic. It was nice, young, and hip, and my light bulb went off. As I got back in Atlanta, we closed the restaurant and opened a noodle restaurant called “Noodle.” The restaurant went well and had three branches which I chose to sold except the one on College Park and Main Street. And finally, in December 2014, I opened this concept restaurant called “Piju Belly.”
HK: How did you choose to open this restaurant?
LS: I was kind of forced to. I have always wanted to own a piece of location. Paying rent on other restaurants was difficult. Therefore, I wanted to own a restaurant including a land. Furthermore, my background is Korean Chinese. I’m able to cook Korean food and Chinese food so I wanted to put these in one place. 
HK: What is the concept of the restaurant?
LS: At the beginning, it was a burger and chicken place. But more like an American pub style. My dream is to have a party of a people of Korean students, Americans, Chinese kids or one Indian who order different type of food and share together such as Korean fried chicken, Japanese ramen, pork bao, and veggie burger. I kind of wanted to do all the combined, all of that together, close to Georgia Tech. 
HK: What’s the rough ratio of customer nationality?
LS: 70% are Americans. 30% international students. Many are Korean and a few Chinese. 
HK: Did you adjust any recipe to fit American palette?
LS: Some Chinese food use heavy sauce. I have changed the sauce to be more mild or even light I also believe in a simple recipe so I made food light in general. Less spice on spicy food as well.
HK: What’s the most popular dish you would recommend to a stranger?
LS: I would definitely suggest Yangmeom Chicken(Korean spicy fried chicken).
